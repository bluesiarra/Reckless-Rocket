config/name="Reckless Rocket"
config/description="Get ready for an exciting cosmic adventure in Reckless Rocket! Embark on a journey as a daring astronaut, navigating your way through a beautiful universe filled with asteroids of all shapes and sizes. Boost yourself through the asteroids of outer space, while keeping your rocket ship safe from harm.

In Reckless Rocket, the thrill is in the challenge. Harness your piloting skills as you guide your rocket through a kaleidoscope of asteroids. Your goal is to shatter as many as you can while avoiding collisions that could spell disaster. 

Along the way, you can collect blazing hot power-ups! These glowing orbs allow you to shatter and soar through the Milky Way.  As you soar through the star-studded expanse, keep a keen eye on the clock. You can play Classic, where you must shatter the most asteroids; or Speed, where you must zoom through the skies.

Prepare to be captivated by the serene beauty of space, the excitement of a high-stakes chase, and the triumph of mastering the reckless art of rocketry. Are you ready to leave your mark among the stars and claim your place as a Reckless Rocket legend?"
